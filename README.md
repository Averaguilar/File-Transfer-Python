File-Transfer-Python
====================

By Blas Rodríguez Irízar.

A small application for file transfer with Python and Sockets

I've been doing it to explore the sockets library for Python. I hope it would help someone just for the sake of learning
or even for transfering fiels trough a local network for example (it goes pretty fast).

There is a Server file to browse the file you want to send. You'll have to bind the server to an IP and choose any port 
(maybe you should open it on the configuration of your router).
The client side just receives the file. You have the posibility to name it (remember to add the extension!).
